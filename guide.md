# Guide to Running the Code

This is a detailed step-by-step guide to run ```main.ipynb```. If you just want to see the code and the output 
without running anything, 
go to [main.ipynb](https://github.com/Lavenderjiang/freshman_sophomore_classification/blob/master/main.ipynb) 
directly.

## 1. Install Anaconda

Download installer [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).

After successful installation, typing ```which conda``` in the terminal should show the installation path.

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment
First clone the repo with 
```git clone https://github.com/Lavenderjiang/freshman_sophomore_classification.git```

Go to the directory with
```cd freshman_sophomore_classification```

Recreate the environment with 
```conda create -f environment.yml```

Wait until the installation is finished, and 
activate the new environment with
```conda activate freshSoph```

## 3. Running the code
In the terminal, type ```jupyter notebook```.
A webpage would show up. Click ```main.ipynb``` to open the notebook. On the top toolbar, select ```Cells```, 
then ```Run All``` to run the experiment.
